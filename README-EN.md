## Regarding this mod

Please do not contact the official team regarding any issues with this mod.<br>

## Features
This mod only needs to be installed on the host's client to work, and works regardless of whether or not other client mods have been installed, and regardless of the type of terminal.<br>
Unlike mods that use custom servers, there is no need to add servers by editing URLs or files.<br>

However, please note that the following restrictions will apply as we are using a mechanism to replace the official additional roles.<br>

- If the host changes due to factors such as a host leaving in the middle of a session, the processing related to the additional role may not work properly.
- If a special role is used, the settings for that special role will be rewritten. (Example : Remove cooldown for vent, etc.)

Note that if a player other than the host plays with this mod installed, the following changes will be made.<br>

- Display of the special role's own start screen.
- Display of the normal victory screen for the special role.
- Add additional settings.
- etc.

## Features

This mod only needs to be installed on the host's client to work, and works regardless of whether or not other client mods have been installed, and regardless of the type of terminal.<br>
Unlike mods that use custom servers, there is no need to add servers by editing URLs or files.<br>

However, please note that the following restrictions apply.<br>

- If the host changes due to factors such as a host leaving in the middle of a session, the processing related to the additional role may not work properly.
- If a special role is used, the settings for that special role will be rewritten. (Example : Remove cooldown for vent, etc.)

Note that if a player other than the host plays with this mod installed, the following changes will be made.<br>

- Display of the special role's own start screen.
- Display of the normal victory screen for the special role.
- Add additional settings.
- etc.

If one dies, the other will die afterwards. <br>
If the lover dies in the vote, the other will also die and become an unreportable corpse. <br>

Example of overlapping job titles: <br>

・ Mad Snitch Lover: Have a task, and if you complete the task, you can see the Impostor. <br>
・ Snitch lover: No task, Impostor remains unknown. <br>
・ Sheriff Lover: You can kill Impostors as usual. Whether or not you can kill depends on the position of the duplicate source. (Impostor lover can be killed. Crewmate lover cannot be killed) <br>
・ Opportunist lover: Win if you survive. <br>
・ Jester Lover: If Jester Lover is banished, you will win as Jester. If the lover is banished by voting, Jester's lover is defeated. <br>
